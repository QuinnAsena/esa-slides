## Is the past recoverable from the data?

Palaeoecologists are concerned with questions such as:

- what are the drivers of community change?
- environment-species interactions?
- role of density dependence and species interactions?
- how can palaeoecological information inform present and future ecosystem states?

## Palaeoecological proxy data

- Typically comprise mulitple time-series (response): 
  - e.g., pollen, diatoms...
- Include environmental covariates (predictors):
  - e.g., isotopic data, charcoal data, lake level...

Palaeoecological data pose many statistical challenges:

- Uneven sampling through time
- Time averaging
- Measurement uncertainty
- Relative abundances


## Descriptive approaches

Many descriptive approaches exist for analysing multivarivariate time-series:

- Cluster analyses: CONISS
- Ordination: PCA, NMDS...
- Machine learning: MVRT, LDA (fancy cluster analyses)

<br>

**Descriptive methods allow us to extract patterns from the data but not determine potential causes of those patterns.**

## Beyond pattern recognition

The cutting edge in palaeoecology is to establish potential causes of observed patterns in species relative abundances. For example, are observed patterns driven by:

- species interactions?
- climate variability?
- fire regime?
- ...

This is what we want to know if we are to use palaeoecology to inform management of contemporary ecosystems or inform potential future ecosystem states. No easy task!

## State-space modelling

State-space modelling goes beyond descriptive approaches and attempts to estimate:

- autoregressive / density dependent processes 
- interspecific interactions ($C$ matrix)
- species-environment interactions ($B$ vector)
- combinations of the above


## State-space modelling

State-space modelling attempts to predict the "true" unobservable state of a system from observable variables. It does so via two equations, one that models the _process of the system_:

<br>
Process equation:

**Something not right here Tony...:**

$$
Y = B0 + C(Y - B0 - BX) + BX
$$

and one that models the _observations_ from the system:

<br>

Observation equation:

$$
Y_t = Multinomial(z_t)
$$

## State-space modelling

State-space models are not new to ecology and have been used for:

- estimating animal populations
- animal movement
- plant cover data
- and much more

However, state-space models are not well explored in palaeoecology.

## State-space modelling

include eq on slide:

This new variant of a state-space model:

- uses a multinomial distribution: accepts raw count data
- accepts multiple predictor data streams in the same model: e.g., isotopic data, charcoal accumulation rates, fungal spores...
- simultaneously fits multiple coefficients
- models autocorrelation structure


Can be used to assess a range of possible causes of observed patterns in palaeo-data.


## Empirical example

::: {.column width="50%"}

Demonstrating a three-taxon model from Sunfish Pond:

- unpublished data: not presenting the dataset, focusing on the modelling approach (Johnson _et al.,_ unpub)

- ACES project interested in abrupt transitions between dominant species

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r map}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -76.6990733, lat = 41.6433326, zoom = 5) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -76.6990733, lat = 41.6433326, popup="Sunfish Pond") %>% addTiles()

## Empirical example

This example is a three-taxon model:

- two focal species (_Betula_ and _Quercus_)
- third 'species' is an aggregate of all other species
- we fit species interactions
- estimate species change through time

Remember, this is a multinomial problem so the we do not estimate the aggregate species directly.

## Time-forward model enables even intervals

```{r, plot}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: Johnson _et al.,_ unpublished
library(patchwork)
library(ggtext)
two_spp_plt <- readRDS("./images/two_spp_plt.rds")
two_spp_plt

```


## Empirical example estimates

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Estimates of species interactions:

$C$ matrix

```{r, summaryc}
x <- readRDS("./data/betula_quercus.rds")
# x$C

c_mat <- x$C
diag(c_mat) <- diag(c_mat) -1
c_mat
```

- Columns are abundance and rows are change in abundance

- Density dependence on the diagonal

(Quercus .99 means change in quercus i
  quercus-betula -0.7 means that abundance of quercus affects the change in betula abundance)

<br>
Estimate of change over time

$B$ vector

```{r, summaryb}
x$B
```

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r, verticalplot}

library(patchwork)
library(ggtext)
vertical_ss_plot_1 <- readRDS("./images/vertical_ss_plot_1.rds")
vertical_ss_plot_1

## Evaluating the model with simulated data

- We cannot determine the accuracy of fitted coefficients empirically from palaeoecological data.

- Simulation experiments are used to assess the success of recovering parameters:
  1. data are simulated under known conditions with replication
  2. the model is fit to the simulated replicate datasets
  3. fitted models are assessed for how well input parameters are recovered

## Evaluating the model with simulated data

Replace with simulation results from betula quercus

## Hypothesis testing

Link back to parameters themselves

We cannot determine with certainty, outside of simulation, causation from palaeo-data.

What we can do is:

- set up multiple working hypothese (Chamberlin)
- couple descriptive methods with inferrential ones
- assess which results lend support to the likelihood of each hypothesis being true
